# Martian-Robot-Society
#

Every robot in the Martian Robot Society is considered a citizen of Mars. The nodes in our tree will each represent one citizen. Citizens all have subordinate-superior relationships, where one citizen may work under another. Additionally, some citizens are leaders of a specific district within the society. All citizens that work under a leader are considered part of that district.
